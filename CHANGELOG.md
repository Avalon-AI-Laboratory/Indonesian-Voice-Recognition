* Adjusted MFCC parameters to obtain better MFCC spectogram

## 20/07/2023
Kevin:
* Edited RNN_T.py
* Created PreprocessAudio.py as a module to load and preprocess audio dataset from a directory
* Still figuring out how RNN_T works to receive dynamic-sized tensor of MFCC (which are having different timesteps)

Idris:

* Implementing audio enhancements to clarify the resulting sound

## 21/07/2023
Kevin:
* Built model:
![Model Architecture](https://github.com/Avalon-AI-Laboratory/Indonesian-Voice-Recognition/blob/9af33e8ee18c944bff26bd4d072c9998cf40915d/img/Screenshot%202023-07-21%20004511.png)
* Changed model CRNN with output consisting of a (1, 256, 28) matrix.

Idris :
* Need to reevaluate the data loader since the matrix sizes are still incorrect and need to be fixed. Additionally, the batch size also needs to be evaluated.

## 26/07/2023
Idris : 
* Successfully filtered audio with low correlation between voice and transcript.
* Before :

Kevin :
* Updated main.ipynb, model.py, and PreprocessAudio.py
* Improving visualization and further audio cleaning

## 28/07/2023
Kevin ft. Idris:
* Trying implement DeepSpeech2 architecture on LJSpeech Dataset, returns about 15% word error rate

## 30/07/2023
Kevin ft. Idris
* Since DeepSpeech2 is a pretrained model and not our original, we want to build our model again using our modified transformer

## 1/08/2023
Kevin ft.  Idris
* Still discussing about Transformer architecture from "Attention is All You Need Paper"

## 3/08/2023
Kevin ft.  Idris
* Resolved data loading error caused by mismatched matrix sizes in the data loader.
* Experimented with different batch sizes to optimize model training performance.

## 5/08/2023
Kevin ft.  Idris
*Investigated and debugged the gradient exploding issue during model training.

## 7/08/2023
Kevin ft.  Idris
* Experimented with implementing a model architecture using TensorFlow.
* Decided to transform the TensorFlow architecture into a PyTorch architecture to align with the existing code.

## 9/08/2023
Kevin
* Finalized the adjustments to the model architecture to ensure compatibility with the existing PyTorch code.
* Conducted thorough testing to confirm the proper functionality and integrity of the updated architecture.

## 11/08/2023
Kevin
* Identified a critical issue in the ivr_project.ipynb code related to padding, realizing that padding with -1 was incorrect.
* Rectified the padding approach, making sure that it aligns with the correct requirements.

## 13/08/2023
Kevin
* Successfully resolved errors in the transformer model implementation.

## 15/08/2023
Idris
* Explored an alternative approach to audio preprocessing by applying audio enhancement techniques before filtering.

## 17/08/2023
Kevin
* Debugging to identified and addressed minor errors within the transformer

## 19/08/2023
Kevin
* Conducted a re-evaluation of the project's progress and current state.

Idris
* Attempted audio enhancement on the data to improve its quality before the filtering process.

## 21/08/2023
Kevin
* Discussed adjustments or refinements based on the evaluation to ensure project alignment with goals.

Idris
* Observed that the enhanced audio resulted in unclear and even worse quality compared to the original, leading to a decision to cancel this approach.
* Reverted to the previous audio preprocessing strategy due to the unfavorable results from the enhancement attempt.

## 23/08/2023
Kevin:
* Successfully fixed the forward propagation for transformer, conducting test for model training.
* Successfully train the model. Building functions for displaying outputs (inference) and hyperparameter tuning.

## 25/08/2023
Kevin & Idris:
* Successfully implement backpropagation using cross entropy loss

## 27/08/2023
Kevin & Idris:
* No significant progress

## 29/08/2023
Kevin:
* The loss is observed and it returns relatively high loss score using cross entropy loss (about 1.278). Our hypothesize is that the data is insufficient. Thus we gather more data (about 40000).

## 06/09/2023
Kevin & Idris:

Kevin:
* Initial result:
