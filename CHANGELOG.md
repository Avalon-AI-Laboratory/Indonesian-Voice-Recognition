Kevin:
* Created main.ipynb and RNNT.py
* Created MFCC Feature Extraction functions for PyTorch module (including VAD to remove silence moments)
* Adjusted MFCC parameters to obtain better MFCC spectogram

## 20/07/2023
Kevin:
* Edited RNN_T.py
* Created PreprocessAudio.py as a module to load and preprocess audio dataset from a directory
* Still figuring out how RNN_T works to receive dynamic-sized tensor of MFCC (which are having different timesteps)

Idris:
* Normalize audio that has been processed with VAD
* Implementing audio enhancements to clarify the resulting sound
